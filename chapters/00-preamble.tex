In this thesis, we investigated the designing, analysis, and application of a novel data-driven predictive safety filter.
% Predictive safety filters can keep the system safe under arbitrary given control input, by predicting future states of the system and applying a safe input that is close to the given input.
The offline design of data-driven safety filters requires no knowledge of dynamics of the system, only some rich enough dataset trajectories of the system are needed.

For noise-free Linear Time Invariant (LTI) system, the data-driven safety filter is equivalent to the model-based safety filter.
The filter is also robust with respect to bounded noise.
In this case, qualitative guarantees can be given for the safety filter, including recursive feasibility and constraint satisfaction in close loop.

For general non-linear system, the safety filter can also perform well in practice.
We propose a method of improving the performance by selecting and putting different weights on trajectory slices.
It is tested on the kinematic and dynamic model of Chronos vehicle.
It can be seen that the safety filter can keep the vehicle within the given safe constraints, while keeping the actual input as close as possible to the desired input.

Question: add description and introduction to each chapter?
